Programs Included (will make UI for these soon and provide them as standalone):

    1. Mouse Move: This small program keeps moving your mouse pointer at definite intervals of time.
        This prevents the PC from shutting off the screen or from locking you out every 60sec..!
           * Why!?
           *      1. Because sometimes you work and some apps require you to keep the screen open for a session.
           *          What's better is .. You can custom set a timeout, and give a large time-out like 60sec and pixelMove as 1,
                        and this program will run in background without even being noticed.
           *      2. Or can be used as a 'Prank!'. Move the mouse fast enough and tell people it's a ghost in their machine...!

    2. Mad Mouse Clicker: A clicking app! Just makes a lot of clicks per second! You can control the time,hence the no of clicks.!
           * Why!?
           *      1. To test something (mouseClickListeners??) requiring a lot of clicks!
           *      2. To play the clicker games! (Well it's not cheating.. It's just insane no of clicks per sec! :p )
