# JavaUtils
A small project to construct various small utilites to make your programming experience easier.

These utilities are nothing but just small java code so that you don't have to code it or so that it's easier for you to understand a particular concept.

Functions Included:

    1. toCameCase: Converts a Utils.String input to Camel Case. - Ver 1.2.

Programs Included:

    1. MouseMove: This small program keeps moving your mouse pointer at definite intervals of time. This prevents the PC from shutting off the screen or from locking you out every 60sec..!
                   * Why!?
                   *      1. Because sometimes you work and some apps require you to keep the screen open for a session.
                   *          What's better is .. You can custom set a timeout, and give a large time-out like 60sec and pixelMove as 1, and this program will run in background without even being noticed.
                   *      2. Or can be used as a 'Prank!'. Move the mouse fast enough and tell people it's a ghost in their machine...!
